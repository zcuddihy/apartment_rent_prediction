# Predicting Apartment Rental Prices

Nearly 100 million people within 45 million households are active renters. Since housing prices in major cities across the country on the rise, the number of people renting, and the longevity that they will have to rent, is only going to increase. Needless to say, the rental market in the US impacts the lives of so many people.  

Many useful sites (e.g. Apartments.com or Craigslist) host thousands of active listings every day for prospective renters to filter through. Finding the right apartment, in the right location, can become a challenging and stressful endevour. 

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive overview of the rental markets in major US cities. Rather than displaying active listings to evaluate, this project will aim to predict the rental prices on a per neighborhood basis given a set of user inputs (beds, baths, sqft, amenities, etc.). 

## Project Overview
* Scraped apartment listing data from Apartments.com to build a database for multiple US cities. Current data has been obtained for Seattle, New York City (Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens), and the Bay Area.
* Performed simple cleaning operations as data is scraped. This allows for normalization of the scraped data for a consistent format in the database.
* Feature engineering
* Deploying
